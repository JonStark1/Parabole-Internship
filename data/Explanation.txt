The simple idea was to use similarity between two words and if the similarity was grater than a threshold value, the words
were clustered into the same class. To find similarity, I used pre-trained word2vec vectors available at 
https://github.com/alexandres/lexvec#pre-trained-vectors. These vectors create a vector for every word. If the words are
similar, the dot product corresponding to these vectors will be greater. 

I ran a loop to find the similarities between two words and the two words with similarity greater than 70(specific to the 
vectors used) were assigned to the same class. The clusters were written in the text files in different lines.
